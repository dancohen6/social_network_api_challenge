## <a name="descriptionlink"></a>Description
Challenge 18's goal was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

While I was unable to record a walkthrough due to MongoDB installation issues, I am submitting my completed code in the hopes that it can still be graded as is. I understand that I will not be able to receive full credit. I will resolve these issues in the future.

## <a name="installlink"></a>Installation 
Install dependencies with 'npm i' and then run 'npm start' to begin.

## <a name="usagelink"></a>Usage 
Provide the information when prompted to generate your README file.
